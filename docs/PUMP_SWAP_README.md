# PumpSwap (Pump AMM) program

PumpSwap program is a constant-product AMM deployed at address `pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA` on
both [Mainnet](https://solscan.io/account/pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA)
and [Devnet](https://solscan.io/account/pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA?cluster=devnet).

## State

### GlobalConfig

The global configuration of the program is stored in the only `GlobalConfig` account, whose address is
`ADyA8hdefvWN2dbGGWFotbzWxrAvLW83WG6QCVXvJKqw` (PDA-derived from `["global_config"]` seeds). The content of this account
can be examined
on [Mainnet Solscan](https://solscan.io/account/ADyA8hdefvWN2dbGGWFotbzWxrAvLW83WG6QCVXvJKqw#anchorData):

- The `admin` pubkey is the pubkey authorized to update the `GlobalConfig` account.
- The `lp_fee_basis_points == 20 bps` and `protocol_fee_basis_points == 5 bps` are the fees charged by the AMM for each
  `buy` / `sell` instruction. No fees are charged on `deposit` / `withdraw` instruction.
- The `disable_flags` is a bitmask that can be used to disable certain instructions. Currently, it is not used.
- The `protocol_fee_recipients` is an array of 8 pubkeys which receive the protocol fees on each `buy` /
  `sell` instruction. Any of the 8 pubkeys can be used in a `buy` / `sell` instruction and it is recommended to randomly
  choose a different one for each `buy` / `sell` instruction to improve program tx throughput.

### Pool

Each pool is represented by a `Pool` account, which is PDA-derived from the
`["pool", index, creator, baseMint, quoteMint]` seeds. An example Pool account data can be found
at https://solscan.io/account/GseMAnNDvntR5uFePZ51yZBXzNSn7GdFPkfHwfr6d77J#anchorData:

```

- The `pool_bump` is the bump seed used to derive the pool PDA.
- The `index` is the index of the pool, which is used to derive the pool PDA. PumpSwap pools created using Pump program
  `migrate` instruction use a `CANONONICAL_POOL_INDEX == 0`.
- The `creator` is the pubkey of the pool creator, which is also used to derive the pool PDA.
- The `base_mint` and `quote_mint` are the mint addresses of the base and quote tokens of the pool.
- The `lp_mint` is the mint address of the LP token, which is used to represent the liquidity of the pool. The LP mint
  address can also be PDA-derived from the `["pool_lp_mint", pool_key]` seeds, but it is stored in `Pool` account for
  simpler pubkey equality checks on PumpSwap program instructions.
- The `pool_base_token_account` and `pool_quote_token_account` are the ATAs (associated token accounts) of
  the base and quote mints of the `pool` account, respectively. They again could be PDA-derived from the `pool`,
  `base_mint` and `quote_mint` pubkeys, but they are stored in the `Pool` account for easier pubkey equality checks on
  PumpSwap program instructions.
- The `lp_supply` is the total supply of the `lp_mint` without burns and lock-ups. This means that if someone deposits
  into the pool, then they burn their `lp_mint` tokens, the `Pool::lp_supply` will still reflect the original supply
  of the `lp_mint`. This way, the pool differentiates between `lp_mint` tokens burnt by users directly and those burnt
  by the `withdraw` instruction.

## Instructions

It supports the following Anchor program instructions:

- `create_pool(index, creator, baseMint, quoteMint, baseIn, quoteIn)`.
    - This allows creating a new AMM pool for the`(baseMint, quoteMint)` pair.
    - The `poolId` is PDA-derived from the tuple `(index, creator, baseMint, quoteMint)`. The `index` allows the same
      `creator` to create multiple pools for the same `(baseMint, quoteMint)` pair.
    - The `creator` is the pubkey of the pool creator and also the payer for pool creation costs.
    - `baseIn` and `quoteIn` are the initial amounts of `baseMint` and `quoteMint` tokens to be deposited into the pool,
      and they determine the initial pool price.
    - The `creator` also receives some `lpMint` tokens, which represent the initial liquidity of the pool. These
      `lpMint` tokens can be later used to `withdraw` liquidity from the pool.

- Liquidity instructions:
    - `deposit(pool, user, lpTokenOut, maxBaseIn, maxQuoteIn)` allows a `user` to deposit at most `maxBaseIn` and
      `maxQuoteIn` tokens into the `pool` in order to get exactly `lpTokenOut` tokens in return.
    - `withdraw(pool, user, lpTokenIn, minBaseOut, minQuoteOut)` allows a `user` to withdraw at least `minBaseOut` and
      `minQuoteOut` tokens from the `pool` by burning exactly `lpTokenIn` tokens in return.

- Swap instructions:
    - `buy(pool, user, baseOut, maxQuoteIn)` allows a `user` to buy exactly `baseOut` tokens from the `pool` by paying
      at most `maxQuoteIn` tokens.
    - `sell(pool, user, baseIn, minQuoteOut)` allows a `user` to sell exactly `baseIn` tokens to the `pool` to receive
      at least `minQuoteOut` tokens.

- Utility instructions:
    - `extend_account(user, account)` allows any user to extend the data array of a program-owned account (
      `GlobalConfig` or `Pool` account) to allow for future fields to be added to those account types.

- Admin instructions (can be executed only to `GlobalConfig::admin` pubkey):
    - `create_config(hardcoded_admin, global_config)` allows creating the sole `GlobalConfig` account on initial
      PumpSwap program deployment. The `hardcoded_admin` is a hardcoded pubkey into PumpSwap program itself, which is
      allowed to create the `GlobalConfig` account and will initialize `GlobalConfig::admin` to the `hardcoded_admin`
      pubkey. This instruction can be run only once, because it will fail the second time, since `GlobalConfig` already
      exists.
    - `disable(admin, disable_create_pool, disable_deposit, disable_withdraw, disable_buy, disable_sell)` allows the
      `admin` to globally disable any Pump Swap operation.
    - `update_admin(admin, new_admin, global_config)` allows the `admin` to update the `GlobalConfig::admin` pubkey to a
      new one.
    - `update_fee_config(admin, lp_fee_basis_points, protocol_fee_basis_points, protocol_fee_recipients)` allows the
      `admin` to update the `GlobalConfig::lp_fee_basis_points`, `GlobalConfig::protocol_fee_basis_points` and
      `GlobalConfig::protocol_fee_recipients`.

## Mapping PumpSwap SDK methods to Anchor instructions

- `PumpAmmAdminSdk.createPoolInstructions(index, creator, baseMint, quoteMint, baseIn, quoteIn)` returns a
  `create_pool(index, creator, baseMint, quoteMint, baseIn, quoteIn)` instruction.

- `PumpAmmAdminSdk.depositInstructions(pool, user, lpTokenOut, slippage)` returns a
  `deposit(pool, user, lpTokenOut, maxBaseIn, maxQuoteIn)` instruction, where `maxBaseIn` and `maxQuoteIn` are computed
  using `lpTokenOut`, `slippage` and the current pool balances.

- `PumpAmmAdminSdk.withdrawInstructions(pool, user, lpTokenIn, slippage)` returns a
  `withdraw(pool, user, lpTokenIn, minBaseOut, minQuoteOut)` instruction, where `minBaseOut` and `minQuoteOut` are
  computed using `lpTokenIn`, `slippage` and the current pool balances.

- `PumpAmmInternalSdk.buyBaseInput(pool, user, baseOut, slippage)` returns a `buy(pool, user, baseOut, maxQuoteIn)`
  instruction, where `maxQouteIn` is computed using `baseOut`, `slippage` and the current pool balances.
- `PumpAmmInternalSdk.buyQuoteInput(pool, user, quote, slippage)` returns a `buy(pool, user, baseOut, maxQuoteIn)`
  instruction, where `baseOut` is computed using `quote`, `slippage` and the current pool balances and `maxQuoteIn`
  is `quote` scaled with `slippage`.
- `PumpAmmInternalSdk.sellBaseInput(pool, user, baseIn, slippage)` returns a `sell(pool, user, baseIn, minQuoteOut)`
  instruction, where `minQuoteOut` is computed using `baseIn`, `slippage` and the current pool balances.

## PumpSwap SDK autocomplete UI helpers

Each Anchor instruction has a set of corresponding autocomplete methods that can be used to autocomplete the UI inputs:

- `PumpAmmSdk.createAutocompleteInitialPoolPrice(initialBase, initialQuote)` is used to display the initial pool price
  based on the initial `base` and `quote` inputs on pool creation.

- `PumpAmmSdk.depositAutocompleteQuoteAndLpTokenFromBase(pool, base, slippage)` is used to autocomplete the
  corresponding `quote` and `lpToken` values in the UI when the `base` input changes on deposit UI.
- `PumpAmmSdk.depositAutocompleteBaseAndLpTokenFromQuote(pool, quote, slippage)` is used to autocomplete the
  corresponding `base` and `lpToken` values in the UI when the `quote` input changes on deposit UI.

- `PumpAmmSdk.swapAutocompleteBaseFromQuote(pool, quote, slippage, swapDirection)` is used to autocomplete the
  corresponding `base` value in the UI when the `quote` input changes on swap UI.
- `PumpAmmSdk.swapAutocompleteQuoteFromBase(pool, base, slippage, swapDirection)` is used to autocomplete the
  corresponding `quote` value in the UI when the `base` input changes on swap UI.

- `PumpAmmSdk.swapAutocompleteBaseFromQuote(pool, quote, slippage, swapDirection)` calls either
  `PumpAmmInternalSdk.buyAutocompleteBaseFromQuote(pool, quote, slippage)` (`if (swapDirection == "quoteToBase")`) or
  `PumpAmmInternalSdk.sellAutocompleteBaseFromQuote(pool, quote, slippage)` (`if (swapDirection == "baseToQuote")`).
- `PumpAmmSdk.swapAutocompleteQuoteFromBase(pool, base, slippage, swapDirection)` calls either
  `PumpAmmInternalSdk.buyAutocompleteQuoteFromBase(pool, base, slippage)` (`if (swapDirection == "quoteToBase")`) or
  `PumpAmmInternalSdk.sellAutocompleteQuoteFromBase(pool, base, slippage)` (`if (swapDirection == "baseToQuote")`).

- `PumpAmmSdk.withdrawAutoCompleteBaseAndQuoteFromLpToken(pool, lpToken, slippage)` is used to autocomplete the
  corresponding `base` and `quote` values in the UI when the `lpToken` input changes on withdraw UI.
